                    <p>
                        Welcome, Pioneer! This guid will help you get started with your production line. The production
                        line is a tool that helps you plan and optimize your production process. It allows you to
                        calculate the required imports, the number of buildings needed, and the total power usage for
                        your production line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know. I'm always looking for ways to
                        improve the production line tool.

                    from the <strong>Edit Screen</strong>.
